## Computer Vision Projects
### 1. Face Recognition using FaceNet
   Face recognition is a computer vision task of identifying and verifying a person based on a photograph of their face.

   FaceNet is a face recognition system developed in 2015 by researchers at Google that achieved then state-of-the-art results on a range of face recognition benchmark datasets.      The FaceNet system can be used broadly thanks to multiple third-party open source implementations of the model and the availability of pre-trained models.
   

### 1. Face-Swap using open-cv
     
   Face swap refers to an activity in which a personâ€™s face is swapped with the face of another person or animal or with an inanimate object, most often using an app or app filter developed for the purpose.

   Instances of face swaps have reached memetic status, particularly unusual or strange ones.

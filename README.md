   FaceNet is a face recognition system developed in 2015 by researchers at Google that achieved then state-of-the-art results on a range of face recognition benchmark datasets.      The FaceNet system can be used broadly thanks to multiple third-party open source implementations of the model and the availability of pre-trained models.

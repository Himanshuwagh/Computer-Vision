# Hand Tracking [ 30 fps ]

In this project we will learn Hand Tracking in real-time. We will first write the bare minimum code to run, then learn how to convert it into a module so we don’t have to write it again and again for different projects. The best part is we don’t have to configure a 100 parameters along with 20 installs to make it run. Within 10 to 15 mins you will have your model working.
